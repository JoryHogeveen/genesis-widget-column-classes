Adds Genesis column classes to widgets.

== Description ==

As easy as it gets. Add column classes to widgets with a select box, check wether the widget is the first, and save!

I've built this plugin for the Genesis Framework, though it will work with any theme that uses the (old) Bootstrap column classes.

== Installation ==

Installation of this plugin works like any other plugin out there. Either:

1. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or search for "Genesis Widget Column Classes" via your plugins menu.

== Screenshots ==

1. Widget admin view
